## Recent Projects :hourglass:

<!-- maybe there is a prettier way to embed here? -->
- [Supplyify](https://github.com/ethancloin/supplyify)
  - This is my most active current project and part of a long term goal I have to create a Web Developer learning resource. I am building a web application to meet a similar business need to the company I worked at through college, a nutraceutical (vitamin) manufacturer! This is the first project that I have gone through the steps to host live using Ubuntu, Nginx, and Certbot. This has been an excellent opportunity to increase my knowledge in the DevOps space and I aim to use the completed version as a template for a 'Capstone Project' in my learning resource.
- [Tutoring Platform](https://github.com/EthanCloin/giron-tutoring-poc)
  - I built this website as a proof of concept for a freelance client. After putting some time into the app, I ultimately recommended that the client use an existing whitelabel tutoring site, since the scope of features they needed for their business was beyond my capacity to develop within their timeline. I gained knowledge regarding timezone handling in a database, implementing a Web Componenet for a calendar UI element, and even Dockerized my application. 
- [Dog Breed Classifier (Machine Learning)](https://github.com/ethancloin/adoption-blurb-generator)
  - I built this site alongside another student for a Machine Learning course at UNF. We fine-tuned an existing classification model using the Stanford Dog Breed dataset and integrated it with a Flask application. 


<a name="about-me"></a>
## About Me :snowflake:
After graduating with my *B.S in CS*, I worked for a local startup in the **restaurant tech industry**. 
In this role, I handled customer support, developed **automations** for internal tasks, and learned how to co-operate on technical issues in a fast-paced environment.

After some months I exited this support role and began a new position, developing for a payments corporation.
Here, I developed **Android libraries** to support existing applications, added functionality to a **Java Spring server**, and contributed to a mobile application written in **Vue.js**. 

Now I work at SS&C Advent, using C# with .NET 8.0, React, and Microsoft SQL Server to support data intensive financial reporting applications. Much of my work revolves around consuming ETL Pipelines, navigating our distributed computing environment with RabbitMQ, and optimizing long-running or memory-heavy batch reports.

<a name="why-me"></a>
## Why Me :grey_question:

I am a proficient problem solver, focused on clarity. Every line I type is written with the reader in mind. I eagerly seek opportunities for learning, growth, and challenge. 

I never hesitate to maintain responsibility for the decisions I make. I am resolved to welcome feedback on those decisions, and will use that feedback to justify appropriate changes.
