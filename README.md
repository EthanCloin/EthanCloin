<a name="about-me"></a>
## About Me :snowflake:
After graduating with my *B.S in CS*, I worked for a local startup in the **restaurant tech industry**. 
In this role, I handled customer support, developed **automations** for internal tasks, and learned how to co-operate on technical issues in a fast-paced environment.

After some months I exited this support role and began a new position, developing for a payments corporation.
Here, I have developed **Android libraries** to support existing applications, added functionality to a **Java Spring server**, and contributed to a mobile application written in **Vue.js**. 
The process of onboarding into a long-running project and quickly gathering information on a new industry has taught me to efficiently identify my own areas of knowledge and ignorance.

## Why Me :grey_question:

I am a proficient software developer, with a fine-tuned focus on communication. Every line is written with the reader in mind. This
holds true even when the only reader is myself. 

I never hesitate to maintain responsibility for the decisions I make. I am resolved to welcome feedback on those decisions, and will use that feedback to justify appropriate changes.
